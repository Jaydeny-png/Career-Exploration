                        known as eye doctors, help people maintain good vision and eye health by testing their vision,
                        prescribing glasses or contact lenses, and diagnosing and treating eye diseases like glaucoma
                        and cataracts. They also educate patients on proper eye care practices. Optometrists work in
                        various settings such as eye clinics, hospitals, and private practices, collaborating with other
                        healthcare professionals to ensure patients receive comprehensive care. Their work is essential
                        as it improves people's quality of life by helping them see clearly, preventing vision loss, and
                        providing eye care to underserved communities.</p>
